Real-time tracking of whole virus genomes
Mechanism for coordinating the rapid dissemination of that genome information to inform the development of diagnostics and therapeutics
Track variations of the virus over time
Access to geographic and temporal diverse sample sets to understand geographic distribution and genomic differences
Determine whether there is more than one strain in circulation. Multi-lateral agreements such as the Nagoya Protocol could be leveraged.
Evidence that livestock could be infected (e.g., field surveillance, genetic sequencing, receptor binding)
Evidence that livestock could serve as a reservoir after the epidemic appears to be over.
Evidence of whether farmers are infected, and whether farmers could have played a role in the origin.
Surveillance of mixed wildlife- livestock farms for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in Southeast Asia.
Experimental infections to test host range for this pathogen.
Animal host(s) and any evidence of continued spill-over to humans
Socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors for this spill-over
Sustainable risk reduction strategies
