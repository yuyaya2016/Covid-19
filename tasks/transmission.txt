Range of incubation periods
Incubation period across different age groups
Incubation period by health condition
How long individuals are contagious, even after recovery.
Asymptomatic shedding and transmission, especially children
Seasonality of transmission.
Physical science of the coronavirus (e.g., charge distribution, adhesion to hydrophilic/phobic surfaces, environmental survival to inform decontamination efforts for affected areas and provide information about viral shedding).
Persistence and stability on a multitude of substrates and sources (e.g., nasal discharge, sputum, urine, fecal matter, blood).
Persistence of virus on surfaces of different materials (e,g., copper, stainless steel, plastic).
Natural history of the virus and shedding of it from an infected person
Implementation of diagnostics and products to improve clinical processes
Disease models, including animal models for infection, disease and transmission
Tools and studies to monitor phenotypic change and potential adaptation of the virus
Immune response and immunity
Effectiveness of movement control strategies to prevent secondary transmission in health care and community settings
Effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE) and its usefulness to reduce risk of transmission in health care and community settings
Role of the environment in transmission
